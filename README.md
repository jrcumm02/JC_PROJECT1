# JC_PROJECT1
Code Louisville Frontend Project
I have attempted to create an environment that tells about myself, and links the user to infomation about me such my art portfolio, architectural projects, and my facebook page. In the future I would like to add methods to purchasse artwork, or to hire services for design work.

in process of making all nav links active
used Bootstrap, for picture slideshow for a polished look
still trying to figure out adjusting the images

the bit of javascript ive used allows the nave menu to be clickable from the menu button that appears on
smaller screens. all else is a use of bootstrap, im still trying to fugure out javascript (and everything else for that amtter.)

I may have to adjust my images locations (directory) I just put the image files into a folder so they would more neatly organized.

in process of adjusting flexbox in order to get a better looking text field
I have alternated between using unordered list commands, and trying to work flexbox, 
Id like to have a vertical orientation for mobild and tablet vewing, however i have not been 
successful at getting the change between rows and collumns to happen as needed. 

I have also had issues trying to adjust text, and background colo inside of the flex box.
I was more successful with using the <OL> and <Li> to manipulate the appearance of the list

link to facebook at page bottom is active
back to top link is active
